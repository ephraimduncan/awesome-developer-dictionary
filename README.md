RESTful Web services allow the requesting systems to access and manipulate textual representations of Web resources by using a uniform and predefined set of stateless operations, in the form of an HTTP method, or verb (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE etc.). By using a stateless protocol and standard operations, RESTful systems aim for fast performance, reliability, and the ability to grow by reusing components.
- **RESTful Web Services**: web services that conform to the REST architectural style.
- **Resolution**: Essentially how large an image or graphic can be rendered on a display. Oftentimes developers talk about the resolution of photos as photos at a low resolution won’t display as well if they need to be sized for the full width of a desktop screen. Resolutions are measured in pixels (e.g., the resolution of a MacBook Air screen is 1440 x 900 pixels).

## S

- **SaaS (Software as a Service)**: Software as a service (SaaS) is a software licensing and delivery model in which software is licensed on a subscription basis and is centrally hosted. It is sometimes referred to as "on-demand software".
- **SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)**: Security Assertion Markup Language is an open standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between parties, in particular, between an identity provider and a service provider. What that jargon means is that you can use one set of credentials to log into many different websites. SAML is an XML-based markup language for security assertions.
- **sandbox**: a testing environment that isolates untested code changes and outright experimentation from the production environment or repository, in the context of software development including Web development and revision control.
- **SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)**: Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a process used by the software industry to design, develop and test high quality softwares. The SDLC aims to produce a high-quality software that meets or exceeds customer expectations, reaches completion within times and cost estimates. It is also referred to as the application development life-cycle.
- **server**: a computer that provides data to other computers.

- **SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)**: SOAP (abbreviation for Simple Object Access Protocol) is a messaging protocol specification for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services in computer networks. Its purpose is to provide extensibility, neutrality, verbosity and independence. It uses XML Information Set for its message format, and relies on application layer protocols, most often Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), although some legacy systems communicate over Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), for message negotiation and transmission.
- **socket**: one endpoint of a two-way communication link between two programs running on the network

- **Software integration**: Software integration is the process of bringing together various types of software sub-systems so that they create a unified single system. Software integration can be required for a number of reasons, such as: Migrating from a legacy system to a new database system, including cloud-based data storage.
- **Source Code**: is any collection of code, with or without comments, written using a human-readable programming language, usually as plain text.
- **SQL (Structured Query Language)**: SQL is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system, or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system. According to ANSI (American National Standards Institute), it is the standard language for relational database management systems.
- **Stack**: In computer science, a stack is an abstract data type (ADT) that serves as a collection of elements, with two main principal operations: push, which adds an element to the collection, and pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed. Stack is commonly used in most programming languages. It is named stack as it behaves like a real-world stack, for example – a deck of cards or a pile of plates, etc. A real-world stack allows operations at one end only. For example, we can place or remove a card or plate from the top of the stack only. Likewise, Stack ADT allows all data operations at one end only. At any given time, we can only access the top element of a stack. This feature makes it LIFO data structure. LIFO stands for Last-in-first-out. Here, the element which is placed (inserted or added) last, is accessed first.
- **statement**: a single line of code that is used to perform a specific task.
- **Stress Testing**: Stress Testing is a type of software testing that verifies stability & reliability of software application. Stress testing is a software testing activity that determines the robustness of software by testing beyond the limits of normal operation. Stress testing is particularly important for "mission critical" software, but is used for all types of software. The goal of Stress testing is measuring software on its robustness and error handling capabilities under extremely heavy load conditions and ensuring that software doesn't crash under crunch situations.

- **syntax**: the grammar of a programming language.
- **System Testing**: System testing is testing conducted on a complete integrated system to evaluate the system's compliance with its specified requirements. System testing takes, as its input, all of the integrated components that have passed integration testing. The purpose of a system test is to evaluate the end-to-end system specifications. Usually, the software is only one element of a larger computer-based system.

UAT is done in the final phase of testing after functional, integration and system testing is done.
- **UI (User Interface)**: the point of human-computer interaction and communication in a device.
- **Unit Testing**: In computer programming, unit testing is a software testing method by which individual units of source code—sets of one or more computer program modules together with associated control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures—are tested to determine whether they are fit for use. Unit tests are typically automated tests written and run by software developers to ensure that a section of an application (known as the "unit") meets its design and behaves as intended. In procedural programming, a unit could be an entire module, but it is more commonly an individual function or procedure.
- **UX (User Experience)**: is what a user of a particular product experiences when using that product.
- **unary operator**: an operator that takes a single operand and performs an operation.
- **URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)**: A Uniform Resource Identifier is a string of characters that unambiguously identifies a particular resource. To guarantee uniformity, all URIs follow a predefined set of syntax rules, but also maintain extensibility through a separately defined hierarchical naming scheme.
- **URL (Uniform Resource Locator)**: the address of a given unique resource on the Web.

## V

- **variable**: are used to store information to be referenced and manipulated in a computer program. Their purpose is to label and store data in memory so that the user may use it throughout the program if needed.
- **Version Control System (VCS)**: a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.
- **VM (Virtual Machine)**: A virtual machine (VM) is a virtual environment that functions as a virtual computer system with its own CPU, memory, network interface, and storage, created on a physical hardware system (located off- or on-premises). Software called a hypervisor separates the machine’s resources from the hardware and provisions them appropriately so they can be used by the VM.

## W

- **Web Components**: a set of web platform APIs that allow you to create new custom, reusable, encapsulated HTML tags to use in web pages and web apps.
- **webhooks**: automated messages sent from apps when something happens.
- **WebRTC**: A browser-based programming interface (API) from the W3C for voice and video calling that bypasses the traditional telephone networks.
- **WebService**: A web service is a piece of software that makes itself available over the internet.Web services are self-contained, modular, distributed, dynamic applications that can be described, published, located, or invoked over the network. These applications can be local, distributed, or web-based. Web services are built on top of open standards such as TCP/IP, HTTP, Java, HTML, and XML.

## X

- **XML**: a markup language with rules to be readable by machines and humans.

## Y

- **YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language)**: a markup language similar to XML using minimal syntax, natively using lists, scalars and associative arrays. YAML is a human-readable data-serialization language. It is commonly used for configuration files and in applications where data is being stored or transmitted. YAML targets many of the same communications applications as Extensible Markup Language but has a minimal syntax which intentionally differs from SGML.
